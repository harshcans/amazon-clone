# Amazon Clone

This was made as part of the great [PapaFam Amazon React.JS Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA-UN_6oNG8)

## Installation

```bash
git clone [url] amazon-clone
cd amazon-clone
npm i
npm run dev
```

This will start a server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Environment variables

There are environment variables to setup.

* Authentication
  * GOOGLE_ID
  * GOOGLE_SECRET
  * NEXTAUTH_URL
* Stripe
  * STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
  * STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

* Stripe Terminal/CLI
  * STRIPE_SIGNING_SECRET
* HOST

So you will need to setup Stripe, Firebase (Firestore and Authentication) in order to get this to work

## Deployed version

My deployed version, that is using a TEST Stripe site, is deployed here <https://amazon-clone-chi-coral.vercel.app>
